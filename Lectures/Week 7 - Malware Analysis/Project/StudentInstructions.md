# Malware Analysis Project

In this project, you will research a specific malware and create report and presentation that covers the following: 

- Overview of the Threat
- Technical Expose
- Containment Strategy
- Awareness Training

**Note:** This website provides the option of downloading the malware and pcap files for closer study. If you choose to do so, please do so in your virtual enviroment. 

**Important Due Dates**:

- Projects will be presented in-class on the third day. 

- Written reports will be handed in at the end of the following week. 

## Malware Analysis

In this project, you and your group will analyze the behavior of a live malware sample running on the Any.Run executable analysis platform.

Access the analyses at the URLs below:

### Analyzing Malware with Any.Run
The Any.Run interface is pleasantly intuitive, but contains quite a lot of information. In the walkthrough below, you'll learn where all of it lives.

In the Main UI you're first presented with, note the following four panes:
- The top-left contains a view of the VM's desktop, which can be useful for collecting screenshots for your report.
- The bottom-left presents a **Details** pane.
- The top-right contains metadata about the malware.
- The bottom-right contains detaild information about the VM's **Process Environment.**

Refer to the below for additional details on the latter three panes.

### Metadata
In the Metadata pane, note the following important buttons:
- **Info** (top-right): Provides information about the file format; hash signatures; required libraries; etc. 
- These are important details for hardcore malware analysts, but they're out of scope for this project.
- **Sample**: Downloads a ZIP containing the malware. 
- The ZIP is protected by the password: `infected`
- **IOC**: Summarizes TCP connections; DNS requests; and HTTP requests.
- **Text Report**: Contains file information similar to that provided by the Info button.
- **ATT&CK Matrix**: Identifies suspicious activity signatures detected by Any.Run; explains why each signature is significant; and specifies exactly what triggered the alert.
  - This is a **VERY USEFUL** pane to refer to.

### Details Pane
The bottom-left presents a **Details** pane. Note the four columns it includes:
- **HTTP Requests**: All HTTP requests made by any process running on the VM.
- **Connections**: All connections to/from the VM.
- **DNS Requests**: All DNS requests made by processes running on the VM.
- **Threats**: Any known threats identified by Any.Run.

- Note the three icons on the far left:
  - **Network** (top icon) loads the information about HTTP Requests, Connnections, DNS Requests, and Threats that you've already seen.
  - **Files** (middle icon) load information on any files changed by processes running on the VM.
  - **Debug** (bottom icon) loads Debug Output, which loads information about errors in running processes.

### Process Environment
The **Process Environment** pane in the bottom-right contains a list of all processes running on the VM.

On the left half of the UI, note the following:
- Click on a running process, and note the **Process Details** pane that appears.
- Click on **More Info** in the Process Details pane.
- Note the following in the resulting UI:
  - The top-left presents the name of the process; its location on the VM's filesystem; when it was created/terminated; and any references to any child processes it launched.
  - The **Download** button allows you to download the malware in a ZIP file.
  - The **Text report** button will give you a thorough report about the malware including pcap files.  
  - Below the **Look up on VT** link, note the **Command Line** field.
    - This contains the command run by the VM to launch the process.
  - Below the **Command Line** field (bottom-left), note the **Indicators of Suspicious Behavior** pane.
    - This summarizes data any suspicious actions the process performs, such as communicating with a foreign host on the network; modifying the filesystem; updating the registry; etc.

On the right half of the UI, note the following columns:
- **Modified Files**: Details on any files changed by the process.
- **Registry Changes**: Registry entries made/altered by the process.
- **HTTP Requests**: HTTP requests made by the process, including the target URL; request method; the reputation of the target server; and the country in which that server is located.
- **Connections**: Details of any TCP/UDP connections opened by the process.
  - Note that you can click the **Show Network Stream** link in the bottom-right of any entry in the Connections column to see the raw data sent over the connection.

Click the arrow button to the right of **Connections**, and note the following three columns:
- **Network Threats**: If the process's network activity exhibits any known threat signatures, they'll be documented here.
- **Modules**: Lists all system libraries loaded by the process.
- **Debug**: In the event the process fails to execute successfully, this column will contain debug information produced by the OS.

Click the `X` in the top-right corner to return to the main UI.


## Writing the Report 

Your report must meet the following **requirements**:

- At least 4-5 pages, double-spaced. 
- Include at least one diagram.
- Report should cover the same theme as your presentation.
- Include works cited at the end of the report. 


### Writing the Overview of the Threat: 

In this section, you will research, source and cite relevant articles and materials. Then, you will answer the required questions. 

### Writing the Technical Expose Section:

Use the [Technical Expose Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-V77cM1akgVRu5JXuUJZXklKcQayxgSipkUeW_XRfF0/edit) to guide you with this section of the report.

  - Click **File**, then **Make Copy**. Select **Yes** when prompted to copy comments and suggestions.

### Writing the Containment Strategy and Awareness Training Sections:

Use the [Containment Strategy and Awareness Training Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mX3p3fo1lDUilX3w3g1Xuqw2Bq_BVyNRm3x89wlmSH0/edit) to guide you with these sections of the report. 

  - Click **File**, then **Make Copy**. Select **Yes** when prompted to copy comments and suggestions.


## Creating the Presentation

Your presentation must meet the following requirements: 

- Presentations will be given in-class, on the third day of the Malware Analysis Unit. 
- Presentations will last 10-12 minutes each. 
- Each person in the group must contribute in presenting the project. (Each person should speak for at least 2 minutes each.)
- Be prepared to answer follow-up questions.

Keep in mind the following criteria and tips when creating your presentation: 

- Focus on developing clean slides with technical accuracy and depth
- Be as engaging as possible. (This presentation is an opportunity to practice your oral communication skills.)
- Consider what in your 4-5 page report is most relevant to include in your 10-12 minute presentaiton.
