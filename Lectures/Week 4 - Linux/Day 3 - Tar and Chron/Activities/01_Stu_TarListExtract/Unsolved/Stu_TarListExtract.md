## Listing and Extracting the Contents of an Archive

In this activity, you will **list**  and **extract** the contents of an archive using the `TarDoc.tar` file.

* Open a terminal window on the Virtual Machine.

* Change to the `Projects` directory.

* Locate the `TarDocs.tar` file.

* **Exercise 1:** Using the `tar` command:
    
    * `List` the contents of `TarDocs.tar` using the `verbose` option.

    * Produce a `short` listing of the contents of `TarDocs.tar`.


* **Exercise 2:** Practice `extracting (untar)` the archive into the `Projects` directory.

    * `untar` TarDocs.tar.  

    * List the contents of the extracted archive.
    
    * **How many directories** are in the archive?

    * View the directory structure  using `tree`.


* **Exercise 3:** Next practice `extracting (untar)` two files from the archive.    

    * `untar` the files `ZOE_0003.mp4` `ZOE_0004.mp4` into a directory named `MyMovies` in the Projects directory. Extract the files *without* the directory structure.

    * **Hint:** Don't forget to create the `MyMovies` directory first.

     * `List` the contents of the  `MyMovies` directory.


* **Exercise 4:** Now practice `extracting (untar)` all the `pdf` files.    

    * `untar` all the `pdf` documents to a directory named `pdfDocuments` in the `Projects` directory.

    * `List` the contents of the  `pdfDocuments` directory.
