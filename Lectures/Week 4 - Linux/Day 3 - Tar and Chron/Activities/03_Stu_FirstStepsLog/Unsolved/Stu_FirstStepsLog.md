* First view the log files from the **command line**.

* View messages in `/var/log/syslog` in real time.  

* View only `cron` log messages in `/var/log/syslog`.

* Next, view `syslog` and `mail` logs using the `Log File View` program by selecting the following icon:

    * Select the `syslog` and `mail` tags on the left nav in the window and view the activity in the system.
