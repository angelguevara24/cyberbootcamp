## Validate Password

* In this activity, you will create an application that checks whether or not a password entered by the user is of valid length or not.

### Instructions

   * Use the script file provided. We've added a lot of the code for you to get started.

   * Define a function called `validate_password` which accepts a `password` parameter that will be a string.

   * Inside the function, check if the password is longer than six characters long. Return `True` if it is and return `False` if it is not.

   * Prompt the user to enter a password and then send this password into the `validate_password` function. Save the result of the function to a variable called `result`.

   * Print out the value of `result` to the terminal.

 * **Hints:**

     * Strings can be looped through just like lists can except, in this case, the application is looping through each character in the string instead.

     * Since strings can be looped through like lists, the length of a string can also be collected using the `len()` function.
