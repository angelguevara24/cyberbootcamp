## Functional Calculator

* In this activity, you will be making a command-line calculator application. The application will ask the user what kind of arithmetic operation they would like to perform. 


### Instructions:
  
* In this activity you are creating a command-line calculator application. When completed, the app should perform the following:

     * Ask the user what kind of arithmetic operation they would like to use.
     
     * Add two integers together if the user selects addition.
      
     * Subtract two integers from one another if the user selects subtraction.
      
     * Multiply two integers together if the user selects multiplication.
      
     * Divide two integers by one another if the user select division.

* Ask the user if they'd like to play again. If yes, go back to asking what kind of operation they'd like to perform. If no, exit with a message saying "Thank you for playing!"

* Each of the arithmetic operations should be contained within functions that take in two integers as parameters.

* **Hint:** The file we provided to you guides you through the code you will use to create your calculator. We also added some of the code for you to get you started.
