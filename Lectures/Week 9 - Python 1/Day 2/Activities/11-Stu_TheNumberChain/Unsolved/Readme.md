## The Number Chain 

In this activity, you will build a command-line game that will ask the user for a number and then will print all the numbers from 0 up until that number.

### 

  * Ask the user "How many numbers?" and then print out a chain of ascending numbers from 0 up to, but not including, the number input.

  * After the results have printed, ask the user if they would like to continue. If "y" is entered, keep the chain running by inputting a new number and starting a new count from 0 to the number input. If "n" is entered, exit the application.
  
* We added some of the initial code for you in the script file. Use the comments to help you with the rest. 

* **Hint:** You will need to use both `for` and `while` loops for this activity. 

* **Bonus:** Rather than just displaying numbers starting at 0, have the numbers begin at the end of the previous chain.
